CyRacer 3D
~~~~~~~~~~

 Welcome to CyRacer 3D, a simple racing game from Polymath Programming.

 CyRacer is only a racing game in a very loose sense. There are no opponents, there's no finish line,
 and there's no timer. If you wanted to just curb crawl for ever, you can do, but that's not very exciting.

 Hammer down the accelerator and navigate the narrow country roads as fast as you can. You get a higher score
 the faster you travel.

 Good luck...

Keys

Menu Up/Down : Arrow Keys Up/Down
Menu Select : Enter/Return

Steer Left : Arrow Keys Left/Right
Accelerate : Arrow Key Up
